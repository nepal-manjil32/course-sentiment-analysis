# Sentiment Analysis on Course and Faculty Feedback

## Overview
This project applies sentiment analysis to feedback collected from students about courses and faculty. The objective is to classify the feedback into different sentiment categories, offering insights that can enhance the academic experience.

## Approach
The feedback data is processed using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features. Various classification algorithms are then applied to classify the sentiment of each feedback entry.

## Usage
1. Preprocess the feedback data using TF-IDF vectorization.
2. Apply classification models to categorize the sentiment.

## Future Work
We aim to experiment with multiple classification algorithms and compare their effectiveness in classifying feedback sentiment.
